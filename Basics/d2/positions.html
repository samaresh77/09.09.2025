    <!-- 
    Position -
        The position property in CSS specifies how an element is positioned in a document. 
        It can take several values, including static, relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky.
        relative - The element is positioned relative to its normal position.
        absolute - The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (not static).
        fixed - The element is positioned relative to the browser window.
        sticky - The element is positioned based on the user's scroll position.
        static - Default value. The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
    -->
    <div class="box"></div>
    <p>
        In this example, the blue box is positioned using "position: relative;". 
        It is moved 20px down and 30px to the right from its normal position.
