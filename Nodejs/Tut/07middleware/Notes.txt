Middleware: Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), 
the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. 
The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

Execute any code.
Make changes to the request and the response objects.
End the request-response cycle.
Call the next middleware function in the stack.

An Express application can use the following types of middleware:

Application-level middleware (app.use() and app.METHOD())
Router-level middleware (router.use() and router.METHOD())
Error-handling middleware (app.use(err, req, res, next))
Built-in middleware  (app.use(cookieParser()))
Third-party middleware
